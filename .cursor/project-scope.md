# FleetAI — Vision & Strategy

## Who We Are

FleetAI is the **AI co-pilot for procurement teams** in complex industries, starting with aviation. We help airlines eliminate leakage, delays, and operational risk by transforming fragmented, manual workflows into intelligent, high-velocity systems that deliver measurable savings and control.

**Our mission:** Empower procurement teams to run faster, smarter, and with zero waste—turning every contract, invoice, and supplier interaction into transparent, data-driven insight that prevents loss and drives confident decisions.

**Long term goal:** FleetAI becomes the procurement backbone for industries where inefficiency is measured in millions per day.
