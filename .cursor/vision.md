# FleetAI — Vision & Strategy

## Purpose

FleetAI is the **AI Co-Pilot for procurement teams** in complex supply chains.  
We start with aviation — where every procurement delay can cost up to **$250K per day** in Aircraft on Ground (AOG) events — and expand into adjacent industries like maritime, logistics, and energy.

Our mission: **eliminate hidden procurement losses and delays** by overlaying AI on existing workflows, not replacing them.

## Problem

Procurement teams face fragmented workflows across email, spreadsheets, PDFs, and legacy systems. This creates:

- **Financial leakage** — billing errors, rate drift, auto-renewals, and double charges.
- **Operational risk** — certification gaps, compliance blind spots, and supply delays.
- **Time costs** — manual RFQs, quote parsing, and invoice reconciliation slow decision cycles.

The result: millions in avoidable losses and critical operational delays.

## Why AI Is the Scalable Fix

Traditional automation can’t handle messy, unstructured procurement data. Modern AI unlocks new capabilities:

- **Document extraction** — parse any RFQ, quote, or invoice (PDFs, emails, attachments).
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — query historical contracts and sourcing data instantly.
- **Agents** — automate repetitive tasks like chasing vendors or normalizing quote data.
- **Explainability** — provide audit trails, justification for alerts, and human-in-the-loop validation.

## Core Co-Pilots

### Technical Procurement

- Automate RFQs and normalize supplier quotes.
- Detect leakage and missing certifications.
- Rank vendors with risk/ROI scoring.
- Proactively flag logistics and supply risks.

### Ground Services & Fuel Procurement

- Support tenders and auctions.
- Detect unused or double-billed services.
- Audit invoices against agreed terms.
- Monitor compliance and certifications.

## Strategic Principles

- **Overlay, not replacement** — integrate with current workflows.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — AI accelerates, humans decide.
- **Compliance-first** — traceability and auditability are core.
- **Wedge to win** — start with AOG, ground services, and fuel, then expand.

---

## Long-Term Vision

- Deliver **5–15% cost reduction** on procurement spend.
- Cut RFQ-to-contract cycles by **50–80%**.
- Prevent major AOG delays through proactive risk detection.
- Expand beyond aviation into maritime, logistics, and other regulated, high-complexity industries.

FleetAI becomes the procurement backbone for industries where inefficiency is measured in millions per day.
