‚ú® Human-in-the-Loop Magic in Action

What's happening technically:

    The agent analyzes your request and breaks it down into logical steps
    These steps are presented to you through a dynamic UI component
    Your selections are captured as user input
    The agent considers your choices when executing the plan
    The agent adapts to missing steps with creative problem-solving

What you'll see in this demo:

    The Copilot provides a detailed, step-by-step plan for your task
    You have complete control over which steps to include
    If you remove essential steps, the Copilot provides entertaining and creative workarounds
    The final execution reflects your choices, showing how human input shapes the outcome
    Each response is tailored to your specific selections

This human-in-the-loop pattern creates a powerful collaborative experience where both human judgment and AI capabilities work together to achieve better results than either could alone!
