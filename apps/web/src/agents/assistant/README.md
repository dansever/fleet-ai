# Assistant Agent with Tool Progress Indicator

## Overview

The assistant agent now shows visual feedback to users when tools are being used, similar to the agentic-gen-ui example but in a simpler, more streamlined format.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Agent State Enhancement

The agent state now includes a `toolSteps` array that tracks which tools are being called and their status (pending or completed).

```typescript
toolSteps: Annotation<Array<{ name: string; status: string }>>;
```

### 2. Tool Tracking Flow

#### When the LLM decides to use tools:

1. **Chat Node**: Detects tool calls and adds them to `toolSteps` as "pending"
2. **State Emission**: Uses `dispatchCustomEvent` to immediately emit the state to the frontend
3. **Tool Node**: Executes the actual tools
4. **Completion Update**: Marks all tools as "completed" and emits the state again

### 3. UI Component

**ToolProgressIndicator** (`ToolProgressIndicator.tsx` - in the assistant agent folder):

- Uses `useCoAgentStateRender` hook to listen for state changes
- Displays a compact inline indicator showing which tools are being used
- Shows a spinner for pending tools and a checkmark for completed tools
- Automatically appears/disappears based on tool activity
- Lives directly in the agent folder - no wrappers needed!

### 4. Tool Labels

The following tools are displayed with user-friendly names:

- `getWeather` → "Getting weather information"
- `webSearch` → "Searching the web"
- `uomConvert` → "Converting units"
- `currencyConvert` → "Converting currency"

## User Experience

When a user asks a question that requires tools:

1. The assistant thinks about which tools to use
2. A compact indicator appears showing "Searching the web" with a spinner
3. Once complete, the spinner changes to a checkmark
4. The indicator disappears after the response is sent

## Key Differences from Agentic-Gen-UI Example

- **Simpler UI**: No progress bar or large card, just a compact inline indicator
- **Tool-focused**: Shows actual tools being used rather than abstract steps
- **Less visual**: No gradients or decorative elements, just functional feedback
- **Automatic**: Works with all tools without configuration
- **Self-contained**: All agent code lives in the agent folder - no wrappers or scattered components

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool with a proper label:

1. Add the tool to the `tools` array in `assistantAgent.ts`
2. Add a label mapping in `ToolProgressIndicator.tsx` (same folder):
   ```typescript
   const toolLabels: Record<string, string> = {
     yourNewTool: 'Your friendly description',
     // ... existing tools
   };
   ```

That's it! The indicator will automatically pick up and display the new tool.

## Architecture Philosophy

This implementation follows a clean, self-contained architecture:

- **All agent code lives in the agent folder** - no scattered components across the app
- **No unnecessary wrappers** - the ToolProgressIndicator is imported directly where needed
- **Minimal coupling** - the layout only imports one component from the agent folder
